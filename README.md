# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends and generate insights into how different factors influence campaign outcomes. These findings will be presented using charts and graphs to provide Louise with essential information at a glance. Visualizations aid in uncovering a link or trend within a dataset, but depict the findings in a simple, user-friendly way.

## Objective
Provide visual feedback to Louise what will help her establish a realistic goal, timeline, and location for her Kickstarter campaign, for her upcoming play *Fever*, to be successful.

  Figure 1 shows us that of all categories in the United States, "Theater" Kickstarter campaigns have had the most success.

  Furthermore, Figure 2 shows that "Plays", have been the most successful of all subcategories.

  Figure 3 gives more detail on the outcomes and their related values for Play Kickstarter campaigns in the United States.

The Descriptive Statistics tab, found in [Kickstarter Analysis](https://github.com/danidevelops/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx), holds even more helpful information for Louise and her campaign preparation. The data tells us:
- Failed campaigns have much higher goals than successful campaigns
- Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful goal, which is not a good stat for Louise's sake

Although Plays have been the most successful over the observed timeframe, Louise may want to look into more information to better determine her plan for success. The "Challenge" section below, utilizes this data to determine if other Kickstarter campaigns were able to come close to their fundraising goal in a short amount of time, as Louise's play ,*Fever*, did.

### Challenge

To determine if other Kickstarter campaigns were able to come close to their fundrasing goals in a short amount of time, two main factors were analyzed:

  1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  2. Outcomes Based on Goals
  
The line graph below tells us a few important factors that will help Louise in her campaigning. 
  * The length of the campaign and its' launch date do play an important role in campaign success.
    - May and June are the best months to launch
    - December is the worst month to launch
